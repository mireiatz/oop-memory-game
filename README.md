# Memory Game
The Memory Game is a simple console based game of matching pairs of cards. The rules are as follows:
- The cards are organised in rows and columns. The player established the board dimensions on start-up (format details in game).
- Each card has a character on one side and an X on the back.
- When the game starts all cards are facing down.
- The player chooses two cards to flip over in each turn by entering the coordinates of their location on the board (format details in game).
- If the two cards chosen match then they remain face up for the remainder of the game. Whereas if they have different characters the cards are flipped back over after a set period of time in which the player is meant to try to memorise their position.
- The goal of the game is to have all cards facing up in as few attemps as possible beacause the game keeps track of the best scores in a Top 5 Scores board displayed at the end of each game.
- It is possible to replay the last game.
